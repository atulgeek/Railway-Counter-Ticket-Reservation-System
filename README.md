# Railway-Counter-Ticket-Reservation-System
I have developed Railway Counter Ticket Reservation System in Java Language which has Admin Login, Add Train, Main Page, Reservation Page And Passenger Details . To Create this, I have used Apache NetBeans 12.5 and XAMPP. 


To setup Database copy + paste reservation Folder in C:\xampp\mysql\data 

And open Railway Folder Using Apache NetBeans 12.5
